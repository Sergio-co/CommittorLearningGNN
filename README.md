#Atomic-level committor learning without collective variables
In this repository you can find the code associated with the committor-graphical neural network (qGNN) presented in the article ``Atomic-level committor learning without collective variables'', Sergio Contreras Arredondo _et al._ (2025). As well, we present the neccessary files for simulation reproducibility using NAMD molecular simulation package and together with Colvars module for the enhance sampling.
