The folder is for a simple test for NANMA in vacuum. 

It containes a 5-ns trajectory from WTM-eABF simulations biasing along RMSD_eq (RMSD for all heavy atoms against C7_eq) and RMSD_ax (RMSD for all heavy atoms against C5_ax).

5ns-rmsd2d.csv: weights and labels for metastable states (A, B, or M).
5ns-rmsd2d.dcd.zip: compressed zip file for dcd trajectory of nanma in vacuum.
nanma.psf: topology file for nanma in vacuum.
